I have changed some parts of the labels applying these rules.

't' is transformed into 'Time'.
'f' is transformed into FrequencyDomain
'-' in '.'
'Acc' is transformed into 'Accelerometer'
'Gyro' is transformed into 'Gyroscope'
'Mag' is transformed into 'Magnitude:EuclideanNorm'
'sma' is transformed into 'Gyroscope'
'Mag' is transformed into 'SignalMagnitudeArea'
'iqr' is transformed into 'InterquatileRange'
